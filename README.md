# Crystals-Collector-Game
Week 4 - Homework - Collect Crystals Worth a Random Value to Equal the Desired Total to Win

## Hints To Play
_Note:_ It may be impossible to win, especially if the jackot number is odd and all the birthston values are even.
1. All values are multipled by 10,000 to display. The gem values are between 1 and 12, it is possible to have duplicates, and the jackpot is between 19 and 120.
0. *Cheat:* Open the console log to see all the values.
